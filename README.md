# hanaoverride
## Overview
I build small tools and write notes on `LLM engineering`, `computer science`, and `security`. I maintain a technical blog and several learning repositories.
- `Blog`: https://hanaoverride.github.io
- `Focus areas`: I usually do various things, but If I really have to pick up themes; Machine Learning(NLP, CV), Security, Full-Stack Web Programming(Python, Next.js), and Linguistics!

## Languages
- `Korean`: My Native Language and I usually follow basic principle of writing and speaking, maintaining a fluent and academic tone.
- `English`: I can speak it fluently — if you want a technical debate in real life, I can accept it. If you want me to answer the questions in the secondary room — I'm ready.
- `Japanese`: Can do it casually. Maybe I can go on a errand and buy a tofu, a bottle of milk, and a toothpaste. After that I'll return your change.
## Tech Stack
- `Programming Languages`: I have used many of them; but the one I actually have expertise in is **Python**.
I'm also interested in C# and Java and have done some projects with them. I could try to read and suggest a code of languages that I don't know much based on the heuristics, but I can't say that's my **stack**.
- `Platforms/Frameworks`: I've done personal projects with C++ with transformers, Unity 3D, Next.js, FastAPI, GitHub Pages with Jekyll (minima theme)
- `AI/ML`: Usually PyTorch, but I can understand some legacy TensorFlow codes.
- `Domains`: I will graduate the university(Korea National Open University) after this final semester, with expected GPA of 3.4. Plus I've completed YearDreamSchool 5th DataScientist Track to enhance my AI Skills.
## Selected Projects
[![hanaoverride.github.io](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hanaoverride&repo=hanaoverride.github.io&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/hanaoverride/hanaoverride.github.io)

- Personal tech/blog (Jekyll on GitHub Pages). Topics include LLM fundamentals, join operation visualizations, study guides, and CTF writeups.

[![english-for-it](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hanaoverride&repo=english-for-it&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/hanaoverride/english-for-it)

- Study guidance in Korean for improving practical technical English. These series of posts received good reviews on X.

[![data-scientist-cookbook-for-korean](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hanaoverride&repo=data-scientist-cookbook-for-korean&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/hanaoverride/data-scientist-cookbook-for-korean)

- I've done some handywork during the program and I'm really proud of it, as it is nicely completed so that newcomer follows this cookbook to follow-up basic principles of Machine Learning. If you are Korean, and If you want a basic knowledge about it I really recommend to fully read these documents.

[![PDF-OCR-by-LLM](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hanaoverride&repo=PDF-OCR-by-LLM&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/hanaoverride/PDF-OCR-by-LLM)

- Converts image-only PDFs into searchable PDFs using EasyOCR + LLM-based correction with overlay output. Includes GUI.

- Algorithms and data structures practice (DP, graph, BFS/DFS, greedy, etc.).

[![Mate-Engine-OpenRouter](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hanaoverride&repo=Mate-Engine-OpenRouter&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/hanaoverride/Mate-Engine-OpenRouter)

- Added OpenRouter Web Chat integration with additional UI to Unity 3D client; chill with your favorite anime character.

![MUNCH.PRESS enhancement project - Backend](https://github.com/YearDream-The-Crew/backend)

- Team project which I took account of the lead; Fully Functioning FastAPI backend with automated CI/CD integration, plus IaC.

![MUNCH.PRESS enhancement project - Frontend](https://github.com/YearDream-The-Crew/frontend)

- Team project which I took account of the lead; Next.js with TailwindCSS support.
  
## Interests
- `LLM engineering`: agent programming, prompt design, evaluation, debugging, defending prompt injections, and especially know when to use LLMs.
- `Machine Learning`: Transformer-based Language models are OK, Vision Models are OK, and I also have interest in Deep-Learning based Chess Engine like LeelaChessZero.(I've tried with orthodox minimax algorithm)
- `OCR and document processing`: robust pipelines, post-OCR correction, searchability
- `Computer science fundamentals`: algorithms, data structures, joins and query reasoning
- `Security/CTF`: writeups and practical problem solving.
- `Technical writing and learning workflows`
