# hanaoverride

## Overview
I build small tools and write notes on `LLM engineering`, `computer science`, and `security`. I maintain a technical blog and several learning repositories.
- `Blog`: https://hanaoverride.github.io
- `Focus areas`: I usually do various things, but If I really have to pick up themes; Machine Learning(NLP, CV), Security, Full-Stack Web Programming(Python, Next.js), and Linguistics!

## Languages
- `Korean`: My Native Language and I usually follow basic principle of writing and speaking, maintaining a fluent and academic tone.
- `English`: I can speak it fluently — if you want a technical debate in real life, I can accept it. If you want me to answer the questions in the secondary room — I'm ready.
- `Japanese`: Can do it casually. Maybe I can go on a errand and buy a tofu, a bottle of milk, and a toothpaste. After that I'll return your change.

## Tech Stack
- `Programming Languages`: I have used many of them; but the one I actually have expertise in is **Python**.
 I'm also interested in C# and Java and have done some projects with them. I could try to read and suggest a code of languages that I don't know much based on the heuristics, but I can't say that's my **stack**.
- `Platforms/Frameworks`: I've done personal projects with AWS Serverless, FastAPI, Spring Boot, GitHub Pages, Jekyll (minima theme)
- `AI/ML`: Usually PyTorch, but I can understand some legacy TensorFlow codes. I achieved #1 performance in 2 internal contests at my Yeardream bootcamp, which are classification and image classification.
- `Domains`: I will graduate the university(Korea National Open University) after this final semester, with expected GPA of 3.4. Plus I'm in the Yeardreamschool Data Scientist Track, and this will be completed in 4th quarter of this year.

## Selected Projects
- `hanaoverride.github.io` — Personal tech/blog (Jekyll on GitHub Pages). Topics include LLM fundamentals, join operation visualizations, study guides, and CTF writeups. [Repo](https://github.com/hanaoverride/hanaoverride.github.io)
- `english-for-it (Docs, ★18)` — Study guidance in Korean for improving practical technical English. These series of posts received good reviews on X. [Repo](https://github.com/hanaoverride/english-for-it)
- `Data Scientist Cookbook for Korean (Markdown, ★14)` — I've done some handywork during the program and I'm really proud of it, as it is nicely completed so that newcomer follows this cookbook to follow-up basic principles of Machine Learning. If you are Korean, and If you want a basic knowledge about it I really recommend to fully read these documents. [Repo](https://github.com/hanaoverride/data-scientist-cookbook)
- `PDF-OCR-by-LLM (Python, ★5)` — Converts image-only PDFs into searchable PDFs using EasyOCR + LLM-based correction with overlay output. Includes GUI. [Repo](https://github.com/hanaoverride/PDF-OCR-by-LLM)
- `solutions-for-coding-test (Python, ★2)` — Algorithms and data structures practice (DP, graph, BFS/DFS, greedy, etc.). [Repo](https://github.com/hanaoverride/solutions-for-coding-test)

## Interests
- `LLM engineering`: prompt design, text normalization, evaluation, debugging, defend prompt injections, and especially know when to use LLMs.
- `Machine Learning`: Transformer-based Language models are OK, Vision Models are OK, and I also have interest in Deep-Learning based Chess Engine like LeelaChessZero.(I've tried with orthodox minimax algorithm)
- `OCR and document processing`: robust pipelines, post-OCR correction, searchability
- `Computer science fundamentals`: algorithms, data structures, joins and query reasoning
- `Security/CTF`: writeups and practical problem solving.
- `Technical writing and learning workflows`
